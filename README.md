# net-chat
Smit Patel and Henry Fyfe's semester project for Network/Info Assurance 3825-001

Instructions for part 3.
  1. Download microsoft dotnet core runtime 2.2
  2. Open a terminal and input commands below
      >cd net-chat/server/server &&
      >dotnet run
  3. Keep the first terminal open and open a second terminal and input commands below
      >cd net-chat/client/client &&
      >dotnet run
  4. Repeat step three in a new terminal. You now have two clients that can talk to 
       each other by input commands. A msg looks like this "60680 hey client1". 
       Other cli options are entering nothing to read messages or exit() to 
       disconnect the client.
